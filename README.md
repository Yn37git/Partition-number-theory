here is a description to each of the notebooks above feel free to explore them *!!* 
+ [partitions](https://github.com/Yn37git/Partition-number-theory/blob/main/partitions.ipynb) : Partitions of n (positive integer) using eulers pentagonal formula.
+ [partition_improved](https://github.com/Yn37git/Partition-number-theory/blob/main/partition_improved.ipynb) : using eulers algorithm as above one but with improvements and faster results.
+ [partition_thm_regex](https://github.com/Yn37git/Partition-number-theory/blob/main/partition_thm_regex.ipynb) : Takes $p(an^b+c)  = x \pmod{y}$ as theorem input and verifies it for given number of partitions. 
+ [q_ser_sympy](https://github.com/Yn37git/Partition-number-theory/blob/main/q_ser_sympy.ipynb) : implementation of q series representations of partitions, l-regular, 
                (l,j)-regular partitions using sympy

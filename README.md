# Partition-number-theory
Partition function is retated to number theory  
(explored by Euler, Heine, Ramanujan, Rogers etc.)

---
here is a description o each of the notebooks above feel free to explore them*!!* 
+ partitions $p(n)$ : Partitions of n (positive integer) using eulers pentagonal formula.
+ partition_improve $p(n)$ : using eulers algorithm as above one but with improvements and faster results.
+ Odd_or_even_Function : A simple function to check the given input function is even function or odd function or none.
+ partition_thm_regex : Takes $p(an^b+c)  = x \pmod{y}$ as theorem input and verifies it for given number of partitions. 
+ q_ser_sympy : implementation of q series representations of partitions, l-regular, 
                (l,j)-regular partitions using sympy
